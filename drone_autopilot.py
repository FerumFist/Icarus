"""
The objective of this module is to be able to do following modes:
 # EARLY
 - follow given heading within set altitude - GA autopilot
 - follow pre-determined waypoints consisting of a lat, lon and altitude
 - pitch, roll and yaw limiter from gyro information, no more than 20 dungarees in any direction
 - RTTH - opposite heading to that of start, 2 meters above start altitude, lowest possible speed (stall + 10%)
 # LATER
 - autothrottle mode - pitch dependent | keep IAS above minimums etc... (Need IAS sensor, pitot tube)
    - alternatively GS autothrottle, limited to 75% maximum and stall speed + 10% minimum
 - stabilization mode - easy fly
